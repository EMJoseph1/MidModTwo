This is a project that was suppose to be a pokedex that used an api. The idea was a user would type into the search bar a pokemon and a link would pop up that would bring the user to another component where the infomation of the pokemon would show. They would also be able to create their own pokemon, typing in a name and type and it would bring them to a custom card with the infomation given.



This project was extremely tough for me. I realize a lot of what I didn't know and what I still need to work on. First thing I realize was my inexperience with hooks. Not only how important they are, especially with react-redux, but also knowing where they are needed and where to put them in your code. This was also my first time really using redux which came with it's ups and downs, I realized I also need more practice with actually using redux rather than just setting it up. I think with a bit more time I would be able to finish this project, although as I said before I would need to spend a great deal reviewing Hooks, especially with redux rather than vanilla react.

In short, I failed but I now know what I didn't realize I did not know and I can move forward from here.
